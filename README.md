Possible ideas for computationally intensive programs to run:
- Particle simulation
- Multi-agent behavioural simulation
- Evolution something something

Keep in mind that the quad-core CPU. If the memory load the GPU computation is low, could have each cpu manage it's own set of computations, feed them into a single stream.
